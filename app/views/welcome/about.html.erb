    <h2>I have been with CB for over 12 years and it has been nothing short of a great experience. Below are some questions and answers about me and my experiences at CB.
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">
      Q: What is your favorite part of being a manager?
    </p>

    <p>
      A: My favorite part of being a manager is helping those that report to me develop their potential. As a manager you may find yourself coaching, mentoring or just providing guidance where needed. Whatever the case may be, helping someone grow and develop beyond the role they are in is a rewarding experience even at the risk of losing them to greener pastures.</p>

    <p class="lead">
      Q: What has been your favorite project you have worked on within CareerBuilder?
    </p>

    <p>
      A: During my 12 years at CareerBuilder I have had the opportunity to work on a number of projects both technical and non-technical. In my current role I would say my favorite project is a grouping of projects falling under organization development for Technology. All of my efforts are centered on helping the department solve problems and reach their goals. Whether itâ€™s finding better tools or improving upon internal training programs, it has been very rewarding.</p>

    <p class="lead">
      Q: What is your favorite weekend activity?
    </p>

    <p>
      I have several but do not get to spend as much time as I like.
      <ul> 
        <li>Reading - So many books and not enough time.</li>
        <li>Rollerskating with my daughter when we have time - She is an inspiration.</li>
        <li>Spending time with my husband - My best friend for most of my adult life.</li>
        <li>Gardening outdoors. To plant a tree or a plant and see it grow is amazing.</li>
        <li>Photography - there is nothing like capturing a moment in time.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Q: Where would you like to go on for a dream vacation?
    </p>

    <p>
      A: It may not be dreamy but I would love to visit the state capital of every state in the United States. I heard someone say that even on it's worst day, the US is a great place to live with all the opportunities we have. I would agree.</p>
